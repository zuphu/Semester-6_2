		My name is Anthony <i>Alfonso</i>, I am in my final semester at Algonquin College studing Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science. My final project I am working on consists of a web application
		that is being used by the RCMP to track drug trends in Ottawa. The application allows people to anonymously register and report information relating to drugs in specific zones. Separating area reports into 
		'zones' allows users to remain anonymous.

		In my spare time I am beginning to play around with graphics libraries. I have dabbled around with SDL and XNA. I created a game for a quarterly game jam called Ludumdare with a friend that you can see on
		my bitbucket page (Social link on the left and Additional Content). The game was created in 2.5 days so it has some bugs and the gameplay still needs adjusting and balancing. I hope to one day start my own company doing something
		software related with some friends. I have gained lots of practical skills working at Algonquin and look forward to putting my skills to use in the real world.
